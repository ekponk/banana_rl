## Banana Game Reinforcement Learning

This is an example of Deep Q Network reinformcement learning in a simple game environment.
The goal is to pick up as many of the yellow bananas as possible. 
Yellow bananas are rewarded positively, while Blue bananas are penalized.

Some pre-trained model weights are provided. A GPU is preferred for training.
